			<h2><a name="understanding_cyberboard_files">Understanding CyberBoard Files</a></h2>
			<p>There are four (4) distinct files that CyberBoard uses when playing any game. Two of these are used by the CyberBoard program to create your game, 
				and two will be used by the players during the course of your CyberBoard game. They are:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<th>File&nbsp;Type</th>
					<th>File&nbsp;Extension</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Game&nbsp;Box</td>
					<td style="text-align:center;">.gbx</td>
					<td>The CyberBoard game box file contains all of the graphics and other game elements that your computers needs to visually render 
						the game you are playing.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Scenario</td>
					<td style="text-align:center;">.gsn</td>
					<td>The CyberBoard scenario file contains the instructions used by CyberBoard to implement game specific aspects of the game you are playing, 
						such as how many players are in the game and the initial setup for the game.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Game</td>
					<td style="text-align:center;">.gam</td>
					<td>The CyberBoard game file contains all of the details of your CyberBoard game from your point-of-view. Each player will have his/her 
						own unique game file during your game.<br /><span class="note">NOTE: This is the file you will need to play your game. When you play 
						your CyberBoard game, you will need to load this file before you can make any moves (or watch anyone else's moves). This file will be 
						updated by move files (.gmv; see below) created by all players during the course of your game.</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Recording</td>
					<td style="text-align:center;">.gmv</td>
					<td>The CyberBoard recording file contains all of the recorded activity that a player performs at one time during his/her turn (or his/her 
						opponent's turn in response to an opponent's attack; see Combat below). Many veteran 
						CyberBoard gamers refer to this file as the "move file".<br /><span class="note">NOTE: When you play your CyberBoard game, you will 
						create move files so that the other players can see what you did during your turns; also, you will load move files created by the other 
						players so that you can see what the other players did during their turns.</span></td>

			<h2><a name="cyberboard_concepts_trays_and_markers">CyberBoard Concepts: Trays and Markers</a></h2>
			<p>There are two more concepts to understand when using CyberBoard: trays and markers.</p>
			<p>All pieces used during a CyberBoard game are located in trays. CyberBoard uses a movable window to represent a tray. Each tray window 
				has a drop down list near its titlebar; you may change the tray displayed by choosing a different tray name in the drop down list. CyberBoard 
				has three (3) trays: Tray A, Tray B, and Markers. All three tray windows may be open at the same time.</p>
			<table cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<th>Tray</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Tray&nbsp;A&nbsp;<br />Tray&nbsp;B</td>
					<td>Any game piece originating in one of these trays may never be deleted; these pieces are a permanent part of the game. There are set, 
						finite number of these pieces in the game. (However many you see, are how many there are.) You can move these pieces on the game board, 
						rotate them, turn them over, or even return them to a tray, but you cannot delete them.<br /><span class="example">Examples of 
						permanent pieces used in <i>Friedrich</i> include generals, supply trains, tactical cards, and control markers.</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Markers</td>
					<td>The tray named &quot;Markers&quot; is a special tray. Any game piece originating in this tray may be deleted; these pieces are not a 
						permanent part of the game. There are an infinite number of each piece in each marker tray. You can move these pieces on the game board, 
						rotate them, turn them over, or you can delete them, but you can never return them to a tray.<br /><span class="example">Examples of 
						temporary markers used in <i>Friedrich</i> include army-totals, comments, and reserve values.</span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p class="note">NOTE: Some trays are &quot;owned&quot; by players, while others are public to all players. The contents (game pieces) of owned trays are marked as 
				belonging to the owning player, unless and until he/she releases ownership of the piece.</p>

			<div class="section-spacer"></div>

			<h2><a name="game_markers">Game Markers</a></h2>
			<p>The following temporary markers are used in this game box:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<th>Marker</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td nowrap="nowrap">Gesamtzahl/Army-Total</td>
					<td>These markers are used to summarize each player's total army size. Additionally, during combat these markers summarize each player's current score.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td nowrap="nowrap">Kommentar/Comment</td>
					<td>This marker is used to make temporary annotations during the game.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td nowrap="nowrap">Spielmarken/Game Markers</td>
					<td>These markers are primarily used to annotate Card of Fate-related aspects of the game. These include the initial turn marker [the hourglass marker], 
						and a marker to show that specific Cards of Fate have already been played during the game [the red &quot;X&quot;].</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td nowrap="nowrap">TK-Marken/TC Markers</td>
					<td>These markers are used to set how many tactical cards are drawn by each nation.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td nowrap="nowrap">Wert der Reserve/Reserve Value</td>
					<td>These markers are used to set the value (from 1 to 10) of Reserve tactical cards played during the game.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h2><a name="setting_up_your_game">Setting Up Your Game</a></h2>
			<p>Before you begin, you will need to decide whether you want to play a 2-, 3-, or 4-player scenario of <i>Friedrich</i>. Please note the 3- and 4-player 
				scenarios are standard games of <i>Friedrich</i>, while the two 2-player scenarios are sub-games focusing on only specific region of the full game board. 
				One of the 2-player scenarios focuses on the western front (France, Hanover, and Prussia), and the other focuses on the southern front (Austria, 
				Imperial Army, and Prussia).</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Launch CyberBoard (CBPlay.exe).</li>
				<li>From the <span class="menu">File</span> menu, choose <span class="menu">New...</span>.</li>
				<li>In the window entitled &quot;New&quot;, highlight <span class="menu">Game</span>, and press the <span class="menu">OK</span> button.</li>
				<li>In the window entitled &quot;Select Initial Scenario for Game&quot;, navigate to the <i>Friedrich</i> CyberBoard files on your computer, then highlight the 
					scenario you want to play, and press the <span class="menu">Open</span> button.</li>
				<li>In the window entitled &quot;Creating Multiplayer Game&quot;, press the <span class="menu">OK</span> button.
					<br /><span class="note">NOTE: It is possible to create an optional referee game file (.gam) during this step. A referee game file allows 
					its user to see all aspects of the game, including trays and game pieces owned by specific players.</span></li>
				<li>In the window entitled &quot;Select Base Name for Player Game Files&quot;, type in a name for your game and press the <span class="menu">Save</span> 
					button. (CyberBoard will now create a set of files named after each player in the game as well as a spectator game file.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="note">NOTE: CyberBoard assumes that the game box file (.gbx) is in the same folder as your game file (.gam); otherwise, CyberBoard will prompt 
				you to supply the folder where you saved your game box file.</p>

			<div class="section-spacer"></div>

			<h2><a name="starting_your_game">Starting Your Game</a></h2>
			<p>In all scenarios, the individual playing Friedrich will begin the game.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Launch CyberBoard (CBPlay.exe).</li>
				<li>From the <span class="menu">File</span> menu, choose <span class="menu">Open...</span>.</li>
				<li>Load your game file (.gam).<br /><span class="example">For example, the player playing the part of Friedrich der Gro&szlig;e (i.e., Prussia &amp; Hanover) will select the game file (.gam) ending with 
					&quot;<i>-Friedrich.gam</i>&quot; as his/her game file.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="note">NOTE: The first time you open your game file, CyberBoard will prompt you to choose the game box file (.gbx) for your game&mdash;unless 
				the game box file is in the same folder as your game file.</p>

			<div class="section-spacer"></div>

			<h2><a name="creating_a_move_file">Creating a Move File</a></h2>
			<p>Each player is responsible for creating their own move files during the game.</p>
			<p>Remember during a typical player's turn in <i>Friedrich</i>, a player will:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Draw Tactical Cards.</li>
				<li>Move his/her pieces as well as perform any movement-related game functions.</li>
				<li>Resolve combat (if any).</li>
				<li>Resolve retroactive conquests (if any).</li>
				<li>Check for supply.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The complete, current rules for <i>Friedrich</i> may be found here: <a href="http://www.histogame.de/e_download.html" target="_blank">http://www.histogame.de/e_download.html</a></p>

			<div class="section-spacer"></div>

			<h2><a name="one_tactical_cards">1. Tactical Cards</a></h2>
			<p>Drag a tactical card from the current draw deck to your nation's TK/TCs tray. (For example, for the player playing Madame Pompadour, the 
				nation tray is named &quot;TK/TCs: Frankreich/France&quot;.)</p>
			<div>
				<div class="caption-area-left"><img alt="Sample Tactical Cards" height="153" src="Images/tactical_cards.gif" width="215" /><div class="caption">Sample Tactical Cards (TCs)</div></div>
				<div>
					<p>When the game begins, the initial draw deck is the tray named &quot;TK/TCs #1&quot;. When a deck no longer has tactical cards in it, begin 
						drawing cards from the next available tactical card deck tray (namely, #2, #3, and #4).</p>
					<p>If all of the tactical cards have been drawn, then select all of the discarded tactical cards in the discard pile with the most tactical cards 
						in them, and drag these used tactical cards into the tray named &quot;TK/TCs #1&quot;. Next, perform this again for the discard pile with the 
						second-most tactical cards in them. All of the these tactical cards will automatically be shuffled and drawn randomly; no separate shuffling is 
						necessary.</p>
					<p>If your nation is required to discard a card, drag the card of your choice to the appropriate discard pile. After you do this, be sure to 
						<span class="menu">Release Ownership</span> of the card.</p>
					<p class="note">NOTE: As you become more proficient with CyberBoard, you may want to use a single Compound Move to encapsulate all of your tactical 
						card draws (and/or discards, as appropriate).</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="section-spacer"></div>

			<h2><a name="two_movement">2. Movement</a></h2>
			<div>
				<div class="caption-box-right"><img alt="Exmaple of Movement" height="170" src="Images/movement.gif" width="200" /><div class="caption">Example of Movement</div></div>
				<ol>
					<li>Select the piece (general or supply train) you want to move and then from the <span class="menu">Actions</span> menu, choose 
						<span class="menu">Begin a Plotted Move</span>. (You can also press the 'zig-zagging arrow' button on the toolbar.)</li>
					<li>Click on all of the cities you want your piece to move through. After you have clicked on your final destination city, from the 
						<span class="menu">Actions</span> menu, choose <span class="menu">Accept Plotted Move</span>.<br /><span class="note">NOTE: At any time before 
						accepting a move, you may abort a plotted move. To do so, from the <span class="menu">Actions</span> menu, choose 
						<span class="menu">Discard Plotted Move</span>.)</span></li>
					<li>Repeat steps #1 and #2 above for all of the pieces you want to move.</li>
					<li>Finally, place &quot;Kontrollmarken/Control Markers&quot; on any objective cities that your generals mave have conquered. (The control marker pieces 
						have two-sides, and come in two varieties: 1st Order and 2nd Order Objective markers. The reverse side of each control marker piece is the question mark
						 symbol used for retroactive conquests.)</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p class="note">NOTE: There are buttons on the toolbar duplicating many of the functions of the File, Edit, Actions, and Playback menus. Additionally, 
				you can right-click on the game board (or on any of the individual game pieces, after selecting them) to popup a context sensitive menu with many 
				of the same functions available.</p>

			<div class="section-spacer"></div>

			<h2><a name="three_combat">3. Combat</a></h2>
			<p>For each of your generals that ends its movement adjacent to any enemy general(s), you will have to resolve combat. This process will (potentially) 
				require you and your opponent to create many move files (.gmv) as you play tactical cards during combat.</p>
			<p>If you are the attacking nation [the active player], you use the top-half of the combat area; if you are the defending nation, you use the bottom-half of the combat area.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="caption-area-right"><img alt="Combat Area" height="185" src="Images/combat.gif" width="130" /><div class="caption">Combat Area</div></div>
				<ol>
					<li>Adjust the &quot;Sektor/Sector&quot; marker to the suits corresponding to each players' generals.</li>
					<li>Drag the army size piece (a light number on dark background) for the appropriate general from your nation's army sheet to the appropriate section of the 
						&quot;Kampf Tableau/Combat Area&quot; on the game board. (If you are in combat with a stack of generals, then repeat this for each general in 
						the stack.) After you do this, be sure to &quot;Release Ownership&quot; of the army size piece so that you opponent will be able to see its value.</li>
					<li>If you play a tactical card, drag the card from your nation's tray onto the appropriate half of the combat area. After you do this, be sure to: 
						(a) <span class="menu">Release Ownership</span> of the card, and (b) turn the tactical card face-up.<br />To turn a tactical card over, select the piece 
						you want to turn over and then from the <span class="menu">Actions</span> menu, choose <span class="menu">Turn Piece Over</span>.<br /> 
						<span class="note">NOTE: You can also press the 'turn over' button on the toolbar, or press the Ctrl+I shortcut keys.</span></li>
					<li>Use the &quot;Gesamtzahl/Army-Total&quot; markers to summarize your current score.</li>
					<li>At this point, you will save your move file. <a href="#saving_your_move_file">See below.</a></li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p>If combat continues between you and your opponent, then you will repeat steps #3, #4, and #5 until a winner has been determined.</p>
			<p>Once a winner has been determined, move the &quot;Gewinner/Victor&quot; piece (the Pour le M&eacute;rite medal) to the left of the victorious general's name. 
				(In a stack, this will be the lowest numbered general.)</p>
			<p>Next, clean up the combat area by moving used tactical cards to the appropriate discard pile (be sure to turn the cards back face-down), delete 
				the current score army-total markers, and return each general's army size piece to the army sheet.
				A defeated general (or generals, if in a stack) must adjust his army size appropriately
				as well as his nation's Gesamtzahl/Army-Total value.</p>
			<p>Finally, if a general needs to be removed from the map, then drag that general's corresponding piece from the map onto the army sheet 
				next to the left of his name.</p>
			<p class="note">NOTE: When combat is initiated, the first file exchange will usually only involve the attacker (the active player) setting 
				up his/her portion of the combat area and revealing his/her army size piece(s), and then the defender doing same (plus playing tactical card(s), 
				if he/she has lower initial score). Next, the battling players will play tactical cards, saving and sending move files (.gmv) between each tactical card played.</p>

			<div class="section-spacer"></div>

			<h2><a name="four_retroactive_conquests">4. Retroactive Conquests</a></h2>
			<p>If you have any control markers on the map with their question mark (&quot;?&quot;) side facing up, then you must now either: turn them over -or- remove 
				them from the game board, based on the outcome of the relevant combat.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To turn a control marker over, select the piece you want to turn over and then from the <span class="menu">Actions</span> menu, choose 
					<span class="menu">Turn Piece Over</span>.<br /><span class="note">NOTE: You can also press the 'turn over' button on the toolbar, or 
					press the Ctrl+I shortcut keys.</span></li>

			</ul>

			<div class="section-spacer"></div>

			<h2><a name="five_supply">5. Supply</a></h2>
			<p>If at the end of your turn any of your generals are out-of-supply (OoS), then you must turn each of the out-of-supply generals face-down. To do so, 
			select the piece you want to turn over and then from the <span class="menu">Actions</span> menu, choose <span class="menu">Turn Piece Over</span>.
			<br /><span class="note">NOTE: You can also press the 'turn over' button on the toolbar, or press the Ctrl+I shortcut keys.</span></p>

			<div class="section-spacer"></div>

			<h2><a name="saving_your_move_file">Saving Your Move File</a></h2>

			<ol>
				<li>From the <span class="menu">File</span> menu, choose <span class="menu">Send Recorded Moves to File...</span> and then name your move file (.gmv). 
					<a href="#move_file_naming_convention">See Move File Naming Convention below.</a><br /><span class="example">For example, <i>001F.gmv</i> for Friedrich's first move of the game.</span></li>

				All players need to load every other player's move files. To load a move file (.gmv):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>From the <span class="menu">File</span> menu, choose <span class="menu">Load Recorded Move File...</span>.</li>
				<li>Step through your opponent's individual moves. From the <span class="menu">Playback</span> menu, choose <span class="menu">Next Move</span>.
					<br /><span class="note">NOTE: You can also press the 'play' button [">"] on the toolbar, or press the F3 shortcut key.</span></li>

			<p class="note">NOTE: Once you save your game file (.gam), you will only have to load move files (.gmv) created subsequent to the last loaded &amp; saved move file.</p>

			<div class="section-spacer"></div>

			<h2><a name="move_file_naming_convention">Move File Naming Convention</a></h2>
			<p>Each player can name his/her move file in any way they wish. That said, it may be practical for all players to agree upon a standard move file 
				naming convention before playing their game. One convenient method would be to name each move file with a three-digit sequential number following by the first-letter the player's (leader's) name.
